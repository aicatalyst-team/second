**Humans and agents, side by side.**

Second is a factory for custom internal software,<br>purpose-built for human2agent work.

## What is Second?

Second is the infrastructure for human2agent work.

Instead of managing agents in chat windows, **Second lets you orchestrate a team of agents inside custom apps you build around your team's actual needs.**

From one prompt, Second builds complete apps **that treat agents as first-class citizens:** agents work inside the apps you build, right alongside your team. They read and write to the same real-time DB as your team does, and get generated, scoped tools to handle real workloads inside your apps.

We believe custom apps are the right abstraction for continuous work with a team of agents. Chat is great for one-off tasks, but shared state, queues and pipelines require real software where humans and agents can work on the same page.

### How It Works

Second is a single workspace that creates production-ready apps.

1. **You describe your app.** In a single prompt.
2. **Second generates it.** The agents, scoped tools, and a beautiful UI, backed by a real-time DB.
3. **Your team now works alongside agents** in the same shared custom software.

## Second vs. Other Solutions

Most platforms weren't built for multiplayer, async work with agents. They either treat agents as an afterthought bolted onto existing tools, or they're too opinionated and end up not fitting how your team actually works.

Second solves that: think Paperclip or Multica, but instead of pre-built software you get to build your own custom GUI for a team of agents, tailored to your company's needs.

---

## The Internal Platform Everyone Needs (and Builds)

Companies like **Ramp** and **Deel** have already figured out that teams are building amazing things internally with Claude, Codex, or Lovable- but most never reach production (security, governance, integrations, maintenance, agent access control...). To solve this, they built internal platforms for themselves.

**Second lets every organization have that.**

Every app you build in Second gets a real-time DB, audit logs, RBAC, agent RBAC, and governance tools built into the workspace.

## Core Philosophy

| Principle | What it means in Second |
|:---|:---|
| **Build the app, not just the agent.** | The durable artifact is working internal software: a focused UI, live data, team workflows, and agents that operate inside that product. |
| **Agents are first-class citizens.** | Apps can include multiple named agents with roles, tools, data access, schedules, and visible run history. They are not bolted-on chat widgets. |
| **Humans stay in command.** | Plans, agent configs, integration setup, and publishing go through explicit review. Agents can work freely only inside the boundaries you approved. |
| **Small tools beat broad access.** | The builder creates scoped tools for the specific app and use case. Tools are tied to approved domains, collections, integration grants, and secret placeholders. |
| **Integrations should self-build.** | Instead of starting with a giant MCP catalog or handing agents every connector, Second generates the narrow integration contract and human setup instructions the app actually needs. |
| **Collaboration is the runtime.** | Agent-to-agent and agent-to-human work happens through the app's shared state, realtime updates, resumable streams, comments, approvals, and audit trail. |
| **Generated software must still be real software.** | Draft and published snapshots are separated, source is persisted, builds are checked, data survives restarts, and production access follows the same tenant and permission model. |
| **Local-first, on-prem-ready.** | Start on your machine. Deploy inside your cloud when the workflow matters. Your VPC, your auth provider, your secrets, your rules. |

## Why Second is Special

**Second generates dynamic, agent-native software.** For each app:

- **Scoped tools created per app, for every agent.** Agents can never do things you don't want them to do.
- **Second is true self-building software.** It generates the integrations, connection instructions, and scoped tools.
- **Agents never see secrets.** Secrets are injected server-side.
- **`agents.json`: governed policy as code.** Each app has an `agents.json`. Changes require admin approval via hash verification.
- **Draft and published are fully separated.** Builders iterate freely with mock data. Published apps only run the last approved config.

On top of that, Second handles the hard parts:

| Capability | &nbsp; |
|:---|:---|
| **🤹 Multi-agent orchestration** | Multiple specialized agents per app, coordinated through shared app state |
| **⏲️ Long-running async work** | Scheduled jobs, periodic research, background runs, and resumable streams |
| **🗃️ Live data persistence** | Realtime DB with Change Streams; app data survives restarts and user churn |
| **🧾 Governance and auditability** | Review flows, access checks, integration approvals, and searchable audit events |

---

## Security & Governance

Second is designed for enterprise teams that need complete control over what humans and agents can access and do.

**Zero-trust architecture for agents.** No agent is granted implicit access to anything. Every capability, every data collection, every integration must be explicitly declared, scoped, and approved before an agent can act.

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Agent access control** | Capabilities defined in `agents.json`: approved collections, allowed tools, integration scopes. Changes require admin approval via cryptographic hash verification. Secrets injected server-side; agents never see credentials. |
| **Role-based access control** | Workspace roles (owner, admin, member) with granular permissions: `integrations:manage`, `members:invite`, `audit:read`. App-level roles for creators and collaborators. |
| **Approval flows** | Draft/review/publish lifecycle. Platform engineers approve apps, agent configs, and integration grants before anything goes live. |
| **Domain-locked tools** | Custom HTTP tools locked to declared domains. Private IP access rejected. Agents with org tools such as HubSpot and Slack are blocked from internet access. |
| **Audit logs** | Every action recorded: app changes, agent tool calls, data writes, access denials, integration usage. Secrets are never stored, only hashes and metadata. |
| **Workspace isolation** | Complete tenant isolation. Every query scoped to `workspaceId`. Cross-workspace access returns `404`, not `403`, to prevent resource enumeration. |
| **Subprocess hardening** | Infrastructure secrets scrubbed from agent subprocess environments. Linux deployments use `bubblewrap` sandboxing. CLI runtimes get allowlisted env + private per-app HOME. |

### `agents.json`: Agent Policy as Code

Every app's agent capabilities are declared, version-controlled, and approved:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "lead-enricher",
      "name": "Lead Enricher",
      "description": "Enriches leads with public company data",
      "systemPrompt": "You are a lead enrichment agent...",
      "dataCollections": ["leads"],
      "tools": [
        { "type": "builtin", "name": "WebSearch", "enabled": true },
        {
          "type": "custom",
          "name": "hubspot_fetch_contacts",
          "integration": { "domain": "hubapi.com" },
          "endpoint": {
            "method": "GET",
            "url": "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts",
            "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {{secrets.HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN}}" }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<table>
<tr><td>

- Secrets are resolved server-side via `{{secrets.*}}` templates, never embedded in config
- Any change to `agents.json` **clears existing approval**, preventing silent config drift
- Published apps use the **last approved hash** only, while draft changes stay sandboxed

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Agents run in the Worker. App-data writes, tool calls, secret resolution, and audit trails go through the Web layer, so the Worker can run agents without becoming the source of truth for permissions or data.
